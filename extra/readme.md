# The Blood of Drakul

## Backstory & Setting

*Every 1000 years, the vampiric 'First House', led by Vladimir Tepesh, the infernal Count of Drakul, gains passage to our world via a dark ritual known as the 'blood omen'. The First House has attempted to invade our world countless times across history, but has always been cast down by champions of the Templar, though their exploits are largely forgotten by history. The last blood omen was unwittingly initiated by the count's own son, Adrian, a 'hybrid' born of an unholy union between the Count and a human woman. As a young boy, Adrian discovered and inadvertently activated the 'Bloodstone Locus', an ancient artifact created by the Count's dark patron, Uvhash, that acts as a 'homing beacon' by which Uhvash's hellish plane of Rhylkos is inexorably drawn through the aether. The 'blood omen' heralding the planar invasion is triggered after the locus accumulates enough raw anima, generated by war, violence, and other bloody business conducted in our world, effectively ensuring the First House will always rise again as long as humanity inhabits the earth...*

*Though the Count was eventually defeated during his the First House's latest invasion 1000 years ago, Adrian harbors intense guilt about his role as unwitting accessory to his father's bloody coup and the grim fate of his accursed boodline. He has lived in the shadows ever since, seeking to reclaim and safeguard the lost locus and plotting to ensure he would have the strength to defeat his father when the First House rises again.*

*In 1920s Arkham, the forces who would oppose the First House are weakened and divided: the other great vampyr houses who have broken away from the House of Drakul are largely disinterested in the affairs of mortals, and many newer vampyr are not even aware of their accursed heritage. The lycanthrope 'shifter' gangs who are descended from Fenrir -- a great white wolf who was slain by the First House in antiquity and then corrupted by their profane experiemnts to create the curse of lycanthropy and provoke mortals into hasten the blood omen -- fued ceaselessly over dominance and territory as they struggle to master the beast within, most unaware of the threat of the First House or their connection to it's machinations, and fewer able to reset the frenzy induced by the blood omen when it arrives.*

*The Templar chapter still operating out of the bowels of one of Arkham's oldest churches has tried it's best to keep the peace between the city's supernatural elements, but its ranks have thinned over the years and many civilians that are still aware of their 'blessed crusade' view them as vigilante zealots and relics of a bygone era. Gerrard Renault, the reigning 'Paragon' of Arkham's Templar chapter harbors a dark secret of his own: he has become infected with vampirism, and was even once a consort of Amelia Mistral, the current defacto head of the House of Mistral. When he became aware of the House of Mistral's heritage and the inevitable return of the First house, he defected to the Templar, knowing their strength would be crucial to putting down the Count of Drakul. Now, Gerrard leads his men with wisdom and virtue...but fears the day they become aware of his true nature.*
