# The Blood of Drakul

## Backstory & Setting

Every 1000 years, the vampiric 'First House', led by Vladimir Tepesh, the infernal Count of Drakul, gains passage to our world via a dark ritual known as the 'blood omen'. The First House has attempted to invade our world countless times across history, but has always been cast down by champions of the Templar, though their exploits are largely forgotten by history. The last blood omen was unwittingly initiated by the count's own son, Adrian, a 'hybrid' born of an unholy union between the Count and a human woman. As a young boy, Adrian discovered and inadvertently activated the 'Bloodstone Locus', an ancient artifact created by the Count's dark patron, Uvhash, that acts as a 'homing beacon' by which Uhvash's hellish plane of Rhylkos is inexorably drawn through the aether. The 'blood omen' heralding the planar invasion is triggered after the locus accumulates enough raw anima, generated by war, violence, and other bloody business conducted in our world, effectively ensuring the First House will always rise again as long as humanity inhabits the earth...
